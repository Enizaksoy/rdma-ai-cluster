# Claude Chat - Versa Networks API Setup
**Date:** November 19, 2025

## Conversation Summary

### Initial Request
User wanted to use VSCode for API GET and POST requests with Versa Networks API library.

### Discussion Points

1. **Working Directory**: `/mnt/c/Users/eniza` (equivalent to `C:\Users\eniza` in Windows)
   - This is the WSL (Windows Subsystem for Linux) path mapping to Windows user directory
   - WSL paths: `/mnt/c/` = `C:\` drive

2. **File Visibility Issue**
   - Many files in the directory are hidden (starting with `.` like `.ssh`, `.vscode`)
   - To see hidden files in Windows Explorer:
     - View tab → Check "Hidden items"
     - Or View button → Show → Hidden items

3. **Current Environment**
   - Found `csdwan` directory (empty except for venv)
   - Found `venv` folder (virtual environment)
   - No Versa Networks API library currently detected

### Next Steps (To Be Determined)
- Decide on project location for Versa API work
- Install Versa Networks API library/SDK
- Set up API credentials
- Create API GET/POST examples

### File Storage
- Conversation logs saved to: `C:\Users\eniza\Documents\claudechats\`
- This folder will be used for future project conversations
